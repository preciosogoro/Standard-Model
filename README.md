To import easily click the < Code > button in the menu and you can download the whole folder in the shape of zip or you can open it with GitHub desktop in which i highly recommend.
  
All the file needed is inside Standard Model folder. The folder called 'backup' inside zombies folder directory is irrelevant so you can delete it.
